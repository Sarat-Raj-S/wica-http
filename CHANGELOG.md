# Overview

This log describes the functionality of tagged versions within the repository.

# Tags  
* [0.0.1-RELEASE](https://git.psi.ch/controls_highlevel_applications/ch.psi.wica2/tags/0.0.1-RELEASE)
  First version that demonstrates the principle of a monitor on a single epics channel
  which reflects the ongoing status on an HTML page.

* [0.2.0-RELEASE](https://git.psi.ch/controls_highlevel_applications/ch.psi.wica2/tags/0.2.0-RELEASE)
  Created separate Javascript "library". Can now create epics links according to
  data-wica-channel-name attribute appended to html elements.
  Each link is on a separate SSE channel so solution is not in any way scalable !
  !! EVERYTHING IS STILL A TOTAL HACK WHICH NEEDS CLEANING UP !!

* [0.3.0-RELEASE](https://git.psi.ch/controls_highlevel_applications/ch.psi.wica2/tags/0.3.0-RELEASE)
  A cleanup of the first version. Each SSE contains a map of channels with their
  corresponding values. Now supports POST to create a stream and GET to subscribe to it.
  Many clients can therefore subscribe to the same event stream.
  Each stream has its own CA context - this prevents sharing of channels between
  different streams.

   - CTRLIT-6622: Add HTML page to demonstrate features.
   - CTRLIT-6619: Add first support for unit tests.
   - CTRLIT-6624: Rename wica2 to wica.
   - CTRLIT-6618: Upgrade to JDK10.
   - CTRLIT-6623: Clean up application properties file.

* [0.4.0-RELEASE](https://git.psi.ch/controls_highlevel_applications/ch.psi.wica2/tags/0.4.0-RELEASE)
  Continued code organisation cleanup, improved testing etc. 
  Build system switched to maven for consistency with autodeploy project.
  Added support for deployment as a service in docker container on gfa-autodeploy.psi.ch.
  Added support for PROSCAN Status Display demo.
  Can now extract metadata (eg units, precision) from monitored channels.
   - [CTRLIT-6752](https://jira.psi.ch/browse/CTRLIT-6752): Create Release 0.4.0. 
   - [CTRLIT-6753](https://jira.psi.ch/browse/CTRLIT-6753): Improve Test Coverage and Organisation.

   - [CTRLIT-6759](https://jira.psi.ch/browse/CTRLIT-6759): Add support for CORS. 

* [0.5.0-RELEASE](https://git.psi.ch/controls_highlevel_applications/ch.psi.wica2/tags/0.5.0-RELEASE)
  This release supports the first example of a working facility display. The PROSCAN Status display
  - current production version [here](http://gfa-status.web.psi.ch/pro-status.html) - was chosen as an example to 
  see what the issues would be in making a Wica-based html version. The result is [here](https://gfa-autodeploy.psi.ch:8443/demo/ProscanStatusDisplayAdvanced.html) 
  The development philosophy has been: (a) make it work then (b) optimise it. The next wave of development effort will
  now focus more on the latter.

# Project Ideas Completed

1. Consider refactoring so that the app only uses one context (channels can then be cached and shared between 
different streams). DONE.
1. Add support for different types. DONE.
1. Add support for CA metadata (timestamps, graphics, alarms etc) DONE 
1. Add support for array data. DONE.
1. Add support for plotting using eg plotly. DONE.
1. Optimisation: Currently each time a WICA-supported web page is opened the page will be scanned for data-wica-channel-name
entries and a new monitor will be established for each item. On the PROSCAN status display page there are 88 items.
It would be far more efficient if EPICS channels were cached and shared between the various streams. DONE.
1. Feature Enhancement: add support for displaying alarm values in different colours. DONE.
1. Infrastructure Enhancement: Apply for 'gfa-wica web' certificate. DONE.
1. Bug Fix: sometimes the Wica Server sends disconnect messages but afterwards the monitor continues to send updates
so one is left with a screen with lost of pink background (pink = the Wica server disconnected). DONE.
1. Render changes to server and epics channel connection state using CSS.  DONE. 
1. Provide some example displays for Hubert. DONE.
1. Feature Enhancement: enhance PROSCAN display so that the design is fully responsive (currently it only works well on 
a desktop monitor). DONE.

# Project Ideas Backlog

When an idea is under serious consideration and a candidate for
implementation it will be placed on the project's [Jira Kanban Board](https://jira.psi.ch/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=1631)
1. Create end-to-end tests to measure performance.
1. Optimisation: WICA clients that connect for the first time should receive the full list of channels with current 
values. They should then only be advised of CHANGES to the value.

1. Cleanup message id's to support the following:
   - metadata-stream: Sends all values with SLOW periodicity. 
   - value-snapshot-stream: Sends all values with SLOW periodicity. 
   - value-change-stream: Sends only changed values but with fast periodicity.
