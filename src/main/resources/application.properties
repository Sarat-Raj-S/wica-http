# Wica-HTTP Standard RUN Profile
# ==============================

# Note: this profile is used for the following purposes:
#
#   (a) when the Wica-HTTP server is invoked directly as a fatJar and runs on
#       the localhost in non-secure (http) mode on port 80.
#
#   (b) when the Spring environment is started during the maven test phase
#       to run unit and other integration tests.
#

# Spring Boot Framework Configuration
# -----------------------------------

# Tomcat server will bind to. This is the Docker bridge IP.
# note: the address will increment by 1 for each configured service in the
